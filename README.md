> This repository is the source code that **currently** runs [Eggplants](https://eggplants.org). In short, Eggplants is an alternative beatmap listing website for osu!, started in **January, 2017**. It was originally created because at the time [Ripple](https://ripple.moe), an osu! private server, did not have any type of beatmap listing, and searching direct wasn't too hot. The goal for Eggplants is to not only provide users with a **better option for osu! players** to download beatmaps using the **same mirror and API**, but to give users a way to **quickly download beatmaps and share them with their friends**. 

> If you'd like to **request any features**, or see currently requested features, head to the [issues](https://github.com/Eggplants/Eggplants/issues). I, [Swan](https://github.com/Swan), have completely rewritten Eggplants for the **third time**, this version (written with **Angular 4**) is what I'm most happy with. I plan to expand on Eggplants **A LOT**  and make it a great hub with tools for osu! players all around.
