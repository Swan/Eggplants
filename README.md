# Eggplants

This repository contains the source code that currently runs [Eggplants](https://eggplants.org). In short, Eggplants is an alternative beatmap listing website. This project was started in January of 2017 and has now been rewritten for the fourth time - while first using EJS templates, Angular 1, Angular 4, and now **React**. The purpose of this project is mainly to serve as a learning experience while sharpening up my skills. Eggplants is pretty much powered on the [Ripple](https://ripple.moe) mirror and API for retrieving and serving beatmaps and beatmap data, so huge thanks to them.

# Features
