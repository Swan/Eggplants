# Eggplants

[Eggplants](https://eggplants.org) is an alternative beatmap listing website for osu!

Currently, Eggplants has some pretty useful features including: 
* Searching for beatmaps
* Creating shareable beatmap links
* Directly downloading beatmaps with osu! beatmap links

To run your own instance of Eggplants locally: 
* You'll need the [Angular CLI](https://cli.angular.io/).
* Install the dependencies with `npm i`
* Build the project with `ng build`
* Run `node server.js` or `npm start`
