Eggplants is an open-source website that serves as an alternative to downloading osu! beatmaps. Whether it be the user is not logged into the osu! site, or is on another server - They can still download beatmaps. Eggplants uses the [osu! API](https://github.com/ppy/osu-api/wiki) to find beatmaps & the [Ripple](https://ripple.moe) mirror to download them.
